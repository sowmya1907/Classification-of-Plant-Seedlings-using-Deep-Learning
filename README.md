# 🌱 Classification of Plant Seedlings Using Deep Learning  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project aims to classify plant seedlings using **Deep Learning** techniques, specifically a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**. By analyzing images, the model can differentiate between various plant species, which can be useful in **agriculture, weed detection, and precision farming**.  

## 🏆 Features  
✅ Uses **CNN** for high-accuracy classification  
✅ Trained on **960+ unique plant images** across **12 species**  
✅ Achieves **93% accuracy** in classification  
✅ Can be integrated into **robotic arms for automated weeding**
